              payments for goods and services, or to receive charitable or

              Stripe Account, or to integrate your existing Stripe Account with
              the Connect Platform. A Connect Platform may also conduct Activity
              on your behalf, provided that it does so in accordance with Your

                  However, if you commence using Stripe Connect again, you are
